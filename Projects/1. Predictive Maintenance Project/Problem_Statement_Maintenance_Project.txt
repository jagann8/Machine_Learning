The ABC company managing a fleet of devices relies on traditional preventive maintenance, leading to:

Excessive costs: Fixing devices unnecessarily consumes resources and increases operating costs.
Unforeseen downtime: Unidentified failing devices can cause unexpected breakdowns and disrupt operations.
Objective: Develop a predictive maintenance solution using machine learning to:

Proactively identify: Accurately predict device failures before they occur, enabling timely maintenance interventions.
Optimize costs: Minimize unnecessary maintenance while preventing costly breakdowns.
Ensure uptime: Maintain device functionality and avoid operational disruptions.
Technical Constraints:

Minimize false positives: Avoid fixing devices that are still operational (wasted resources).
Minimize false negatives: Identify all devices at risk of failure to prevent breakdowns.
Model interpretability: Understand the factors contributing to failures for targeted interventions.
Data Availability:

Historical sensor data from devices, including various readings and timestamps.
Device failure labels (0 = no failure, 1 = failure).
Desired Outcome:

Implement a machine learning model that accurately predicts device failures, optimizes maintenance scheduling, and reduces costs while ensuring operational uptime.

This problem statement clearly defines the issue, the desired outcome, and the technical constraints. It also specifies the available data and highlights the impact of solving this problem.
